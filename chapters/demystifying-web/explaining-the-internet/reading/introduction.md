# Explaining the Internet

## Introduction

In this session, we'll discuss some networking fundamentals.
By doing so, we'll lay the foundations for some of our later sessions regarding networking and the internet, such as [(Re)Discovering the Browser](../../rediscovering-the-browser/)
and [Hacking the Web](../../hacking-the-web/).

Moreover, we'll explain what happens when you access a URL (we'll also learn how to do this from our terminals).
Last but not least, we'll see what those `ssh` commands you've been using in order to solve the remote challenges mean.

## Reminders and Prerequisites

For this session, you'll need:

- a working internet connection;
- a Linux environment that you're comfortable working with;
- to understand what a *process* is;
- general knowledge of the Linux CLI, as discussed in session [Welcome to Linux](../../../scratch-linux/welcome-to-linux/).
